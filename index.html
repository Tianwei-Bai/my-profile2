       This is my favourite film.The first time I saw this film I was in the kindergarden, at that time I was a little scared of the story and the characters in the films but even though I was extremely attracted by the film. After than when I was older I have been watching the film for so many times that I've already recited the story, but I still enjoy the time of watching it.

        It's my hometown's club and has a wonderful history. When I was young in 2008, my father brought me to the stadium and from that time I became a real fan of this club.I can even remember the match was contre Dalian and we won as 2-1.Since then I have already followed the club for 11 years, the club has become a part of my life. The most famous foreign player of the club is Didier Drogba(in the second half of the season2012)and Carlos Alberto Mart√≠nez Tevez(in the season2017).And we have the best fans in China, we cheer all the time during the match to encourage our players.Our captain, Giovanni Moreno, has already played for 7 years though he is Columbian, and with his lead, we won the championship of Chinese cup in 2017, now he is guiding the team to win the honor agian.
